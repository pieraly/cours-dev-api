# Sports Jersey Management System - API for Customer, Jersey, and Order Management

The Sports Jersey Management System API allows customers to interact with an online platform to browse, purchase, and manage sports jerseys. It provides functionalities for customer, jersey, and order management. ðŸŽ½
Our company, SPM Sports, specializes in selling sports jerseys from various popular teams and players. âš½
To provide a seamless user experience and facilitate business operations, we have developed a robust API that enables customers to access a wide catalog of jerseys, place orders, and manage their customer profile.

## Customers

The API offers functionalities for customer management. Customers can create an account, log in, and update their personal information. They can also view their order history and manage their notification preferences.

## Jerseys

The API provides functionalities for jersey management. Customers can browse the available jersey catalog, perform searches, filter by team, player, or category, and retrieve details for each jersey, including its name, price, availability, and stock. Customers can also add jerseys to their cart and place orders.

## Orders

Orders represent jersey purchases made by customers. The API allows customers to create new orders by providing the necessary information such as the customer's identifier, jersey identifier, desired quantity, and calculates the total order amount. Customers can also view their past order history.

## Authentication and Security

To ensure the security and confidentiality of customer data, the API implements authentication mechanisms based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Customers must authenticate with their credentials before accessing protected API features.

## Documentation and Usage

Comprehensive documentation of the API, including available endpoints, data schemas, request and response examples, is automatically generated and accessible through the interactive Swagger UI documentation interface. Developers can refer to the documentation to understand how to use the API, integrate functionalities into their own applications, and perform testing.

We hope that our API will facilitate access to sports jerseys for our customers, enhance their shopping experience, and contribute to the success of our business.
